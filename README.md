1. Car_Price_Prediction

   ðŸš— Second-Hand Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the selling price of second-hand cars based on key features like brand, model, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, engine size, and max power. It also includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pickle)
- Linear Regression Model
- Streamlit (Web Interface)
- Power BI (Data Visualization)
- Google Colab / Jupyter (for development)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
- Predicts car prices using a trained ML model
- Converts raw data like "1197 CC", "74 bhp" into usable float values
- Cleans and handles missing data
- Interactive UI to input car details and get price instantly
- Dashboard insights using Power BI

## ðŸ§ª Inputs for Prediction
- Car Brand and Model
- Year of Manufacture
- Kilometers Driven
- Engine Capacity (CC)
- Max Power (BHP)

## ðŸ’» How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to view dashboard
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   `bash
   streamlit run app.py
